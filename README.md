These are drop in libraries for using Amazon Web Services with flamework. They
are currently very much a work in progress and incomplete.

At the moment the only thing(s) they can do are PUT files in S3 and genereated
pre-signed upload forms for uploading file to S3 from a webpage.

They are also currently dependant on my copy of flamework (and its updates to
lib_http).
